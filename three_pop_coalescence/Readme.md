Whole pipeline to perform demographic inference using 3populations

Currently implements the Strict Isolation and Isolation w Migration models
Allows to compare different topologies and SI and all possible direction of migration in IM.
Rscript for ```model selection``` still beta 

Will update more soon....

the full coalescence pipeline is in ```Simul_full_3pop.R```

Models are specified in the ```models``` folder and are all parallelised to run on clusters of CPU

One can run many more models by creating new ```model.*.sh``` and ```model_job_array*.sh``` files according to its needs

No other installation than ```ms``` and the R ```pegas``` packages are required

to compile ms: ```gcc -o ms ms.c streec.c rand1.c -lm```

I strongly advise to read ms documentation and have a good background in abc
